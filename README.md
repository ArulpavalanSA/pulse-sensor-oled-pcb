# 🩺 Pulse Sensor + OLED PCB Design

This is my **first custom PCB** designed using **KiCad**, featuring:
- 🔌 Arduino Nano (V3.x) as the microcontroller
- ❤️ MAX30102 Pulse Sensor
- 📟 SSD1306 OLED Display (I2C)
- 🔘 3 Push Buttons (with debouncing capacitors)
- 💡 1 Status LED

## 📐 Design Highlights

- ✅ Two-layer PCB (traces on top and bottom)
- 🔄 Mixed vector routing + vias for inter-layer connections
- 📏 Compact layout for easy prototyping
- 🛠️ Made with KiCad 6.x
